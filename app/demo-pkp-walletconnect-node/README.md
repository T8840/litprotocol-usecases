# PKP WalletConnect Node.js Example ðŸ“²

This project is a Node.js application that demonstrates the use of the `@lit-protocol/pkp-walletconnect` package for interacting with dApps.

## ðŸ’» Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd ./apps/demo-pkp-walletconnect-node

npm install
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

At the `Connect to dapp` prompt, input the URI for the dApp you wish to connect to. The application will log session proposals, requests, and deletions and respond to them accordingly.

Use this [React test dApp](https://react-app.walletconnect.com/) to test the application.
